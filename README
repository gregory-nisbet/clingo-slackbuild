clingo (A grounder and solver for logic programs)

Clingo is part of the Potassco project for Answer Set Programming 
(ASP). ASP offers a simple and powerful modeling language to describe
combinatorial problems as logic programs. The clingo system then
takes such a logic program and computes answer sets representing
solutions to the given problem. To get an idea, check our Getting
Started page (https://potassco.org/doc/start/) and the online version
of clingo (https://potassco.org/clingo/run/).
