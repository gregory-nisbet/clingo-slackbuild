# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

clingo: clingo (A grounder and solver for logic programs)
clingo:
clingo: Clingo is part of the Potassco project for Answer Set Programming 
clingo: (ASP). ASP offers a simple and powerful modeling language to describe
clingo: combinatorial problems as logic programs. The clingo system then
clingo: takes such a logic program and computes answer sets representing
clingo: solutions to the given problem. To get an idea, check our Getting
clingo: Started page (https://potassco.org/doc/start/) and the online version
clingo: of clingo (https://potassco.org/clingo/run/).
